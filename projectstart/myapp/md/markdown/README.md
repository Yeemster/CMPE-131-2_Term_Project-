How to Play the Game (Version .8, rules subject change):
*The game help screen is currently outdated...please read this file for final instructions.

1. Navigate ship using mouse cursor, left and right.
2. Try not to get hit by the meteors, otherwise, the game ends.
3. Shoot using left click.
4. Every time a meteor is shot, the score increments and the inequality changes.

There is an inequality that must not be breached on the top of the screen, 
hiting each special meteor affects the inequality in a certain way
The ultimate goal is to preserve the inequalities True state
Below are 4 types of meteors which may affect the inequality when hit:

-Red meteor: multiplies the left side by 2.
-Purple meteor: divides the left side by 2.
-Green meteor: subtracts 1 from the left side. 
-Pink meteor: adds 1 to the left side. 

At the moment you may not be able to return to the main menu after Gameover as that feature is currently being worked on.
Moreover, we plan to balance the game, add user/login capabilities, add more inequalities, and math objects (meteors) in the future constituting more gamemodes. Database capalities is yet to be added.
